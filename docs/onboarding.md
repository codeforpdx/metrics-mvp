# Welcome to OpenTransit!

## Project summary

OpenTransit is dedicated to empowering people around the world to work with local governments to improve public transit using data. The project originated at the [San Francisco Brigade](https://muni.opentransit.city/) and we extended it to [PDX](http://opentransit-youngj.herokuapp.com/). We‚Äôre doing this by visualizing real-time data of the TriMet system so riders understand bus speed and reliability, and using the data to improve the TriMet system.

## Get started

1. Join [Code for PDX Slack](http://www.codeforpdx.org/welcome).
2. Post your email and GitHub name on the **#opentransit-pdx** channel and we‚Äôll add you to our [GitHub](https://github.com/codeforpdx/opentransit-metrics) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10usf0ddMH1Z8Q06ZsHqacKROm3xZ4NZe?usp=sharing).
3. Try our [PDX MVP demo](http://opentransit-youngj.herokuapp.com/). What are the stats on your most common bus trip?

## Ready to contribute?

1. Get [opentransit-metrics](https://github.com/codeforpdx/opentransit-metrics) cloned and running on your computer.
2. Play around with [opentransit-metrics](https://github.com/codeforpdx/opentransit-metrics) and see if you find any problems with the data or functionality. [File an issue](https://github.com/codeforpdx/opentransit-metrics/issues) with the problem you found.
3. [Find a GitHub issue labeled ‚ÄúGood First Issue,‚Äù](https://github.com/codeforpdx/opentransit-metrics/labels/Good%20First%20Issue) ideally one without anyone already assigned to it. Take a crack at it ‚Äî ask on Slack if you have a question!

- If someone‚Äôs already assigned to a task you want to work on, ask the team if that person is still working on it ‚Äî sometimes people move on to other tasks, so you may be able to pick it up anyway.

4. Join our virtual meeting on Thursdays at 7pm, with call information shared via the Slack channel.

## Our development process

1. [Create a new GitHub branch.](https://github.com/codeforpdx/opentransit-metrics)
2. Build your feature.
3. Make a pull request. Request reviews from members of the team; you‚Äôll need their approval to merge.

- Good people to ask for reviews:
  - Data science -- youngj, benji
  - Frontend -- Curtis Barnard
  - Backend -- youngj, benji
  - Code refactoring -- ?
  - Deployment -- youngj
  - UI/UX -- Curtis Barnard
- When in doubt, ask more people for reviews!
- Include screenshots whenever you‚Äôre building a frontend feature.
